This is a twofold learning project:

1. Its content is a mean for learning about `three.js`

2. Its structure is a mean for learning some new skills and strengthening some other, as for example:
   1. Basic tailwind use
   2. Tailwind `@apply` directive
   3. Angular content projection
   4. Angular dynamic component rendering
   5. Angular new `@for` syntax
   6. Deploying an Angular website to github pages
