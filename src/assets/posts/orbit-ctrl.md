# Orbit Controls

[Orbit Controls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) are one of the *controls* helper functions.

Controls helpers simplify manipulating the camera position.

In particular, orbit controls move a camera relatively to a target point ($\textbf{t}$), represented by a vector $\textbf{t} \in \mathbb{R}^3$.

The orbit control lets the user:

- rotate the camera around the target
- pan the camera and consequently move the target point
- zoom the camera towards and from the target point
